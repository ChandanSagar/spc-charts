# Running GitLab Runner

The [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is the open source project that is used to run your jobs and send the results back to GitLab. It is used in conjunction with [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/), the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab that coordinates the jobs.
